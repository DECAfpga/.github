Search repositories by categories with these topic keywords: computers, consoles, arcades, others, demistify, deca, 3pins, mergefork, cape

Repositories with the '3pins' topic only work with old Mister SDRAMs with the 3 extra pins.

Repositories with the 'cape' topic work ok with the [Deca Retro cape](https://github.com/somhi/DECA_retro_cape_2).

Repositories with the 'mergefork' topic are just a mirror and need to be keep up-to-date with the upstream repository.
